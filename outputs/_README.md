# _README OUTPUTS

This directory contains the outputs for the clustering. 

* pre_cluster_plot.png: This file is a plot visualizing the data filtered in data_exploration.rmd. It shows the bone measurements as well as the various categorical variables (extinction status, flightlessness, and Order). 

* centered_clusters.png: This plot shows the bone measurement data clustered, with the centers of the clusters labeled as numbers. k = 7.

* tot.withinss_minimization.png: This plot shows the Total Within Sum of Squares for the data with varying k values. The red line shows the k that was chosen for clustering.

* final_clustered_plots.png: This plot shows the same categorical variables, combined with cluster centers labeled as integers, and clusters encircled with ellipses.
